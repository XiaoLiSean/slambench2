# Life-long Semantic SLAM on OpenLORIS-scene #
This project is intended to discuss the limitation of state-of-art SLAM algorithms in dealing with life-long dynamics. Our objective is to develop a mechanism integrating the semantic information of life-long dynamics objects (e.g. furniture) on mapping while simultaneously improve the performance of localization and relocalization.
